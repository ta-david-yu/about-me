`Boomeranger is a 3D action roguelike game made for 3D game programming class in college with two of my classmates, which are both programmers, using Unity Engine. 
My first attempt to implement a proper 3d character controller.

You play as a bounty hunter who uses a boomerang as the weapon, hunting powerful monsters in a procedurally generated dungeon.
In each playthrough, the dungeon is randomly generated. Once your character dies, you will have to start all over again in a new dungeon.

| Feature   | Description |
| --------- | ------- |
| 3D Character Controller | Including a custom 3D rigidbody controller that can handle on-slope movement / external force physics and an airborne boss character controller. |
| Camera Controller | A 3D camera system that can be switched between MMORPG style camera and TPS style camera. |

Other non-programming stuff:

| Feature   | Description |
| --------- | ------- |
| Character Modeling | Build character models using MagicaVoxel. |
| Character Animation | Create character animations using Unity built-in animation system. |
