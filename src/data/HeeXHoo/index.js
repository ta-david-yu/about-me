`Hee X Hoo is a 2D adventure game made for Global Game Jam 2018 "TRANSMISSION" using Unity Engine.
This is an alt-ctrl game using BOSS-ME-80, but it is also playable with mouse & keyboard.
I did most of the programming and level design, reused systems I made for Gerritory, e.g., Audio System and Tween Manager.
Besides myself, there are two artists and two sound designers in our team.

In Hee X Hoo, you play as a plankton that can only move by inhaling and exhaling. Throughout the journey, you will encounter several hostiles and obstacles. 
Your goal is to keep your plankton alive and reach the goal.

| Feature   | Description |
