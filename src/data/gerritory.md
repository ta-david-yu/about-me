[Gerritory]

Gerritory is a multiplayer party game.
Following are some of my contribution related to programming:

- EasingSystem: something simliar to DOTween, let users play easing animation easily (put a gif to show it)
- LayeredAudioSystem: sort audio into layers so player can adjust volume for different layers (ex. sound effect, music)
- CollectablesEditor: make use of Unity Editor API to create a Custom Editor for editing in game collectables
- GenericFiniteStateMachine: base class for various systems that have complex state transitions
- SceneLoadingSystem: besides Unity built-in scene management, add a task manager that can handle tasks assigned from other system during scene loading (ex. procedurally generating level, syncing level across internet)
- Some special effects using shader
Oh! By the way, I made this trailer using Adobe Premiere
